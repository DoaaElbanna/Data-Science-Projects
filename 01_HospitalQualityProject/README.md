## Hospital Quality Project

In this project I work with dataset from The Hosptial Compare web site run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The web site provide data and information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certied hospitals in the U.S.

For this project we use only a subset of data which the web site contains.

First you can found the data set files in [Data_files](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/01_HospitalQualityProject/Data_files).

## what we are going to do in this project:

1- Plot the 30-day mortality rates for heart attack

2- Finding the best hospital in a state

3- Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state

4- Ranking hospitals in all states

And The documentation about the project in [HospitalQualityProject](HospitalQualityProject.md) file, and [R code files](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/01_HospitalQualityProject/R-implementation)

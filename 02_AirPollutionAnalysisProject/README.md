## AirPollutionAnalysisProject

In this project I created three functions that interact with a dataset is contained in a zip file [specdata.zip](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/02_AirPollutionAnalysisProject/Data_files).

By these functions I do some explorotary data like: calculates the mean of a pollutant, return the number of complete cases(observations that do not have any missing values) in each data file, calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations.

## what we are going to do in this project:

### Implementation three functions using R to do that:

1-  Function named “pollutantmean” that calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors.

2-  Function named “complete”, that reads a directory full of files and returns the number of complete cases in each data file.

3- Function named “corr”, it takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations.

You can found the documentaion for this project in [AirPollutionAnalysisProject](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/02_AirPollutionAnalysisProject/AirPollutionAnalysisProject.md) file and the R implementaion in [implementation_files](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/02_AirPollutionAnalysisProject/R-implementation)

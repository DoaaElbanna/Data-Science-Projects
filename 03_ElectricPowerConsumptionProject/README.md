## Electric Power Consumption Exploratory Analysis Project

In this project Iâ€™m performing some exploratory graphs to understanding the data and its properities and explore if there any patterns in data.

The DataSet which is used in this project is [ Electric power consumption ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The goal for this project is to explore how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
you can find the documentaion in [ElectricPowerConsumptionProject](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/03_ElectricPowerConsumptionProject/ElectricPowerConsumptionProject.md) file.

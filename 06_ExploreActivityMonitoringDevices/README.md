## Explore Activity Monitoring Devices Project

In this project use data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

### Data Set:
- [Activity Montoring Data](https://github.com/DoaaElbanna/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/06_ExploreActivityMonitoringDevices/Data_file/activity.zip)

## what we are going to do:

 1- Find the mean total number of steps taken per day.

 2- Find What is the average daily activity pattern.

 3- Find if there are differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.

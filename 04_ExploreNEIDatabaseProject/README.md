## Explore NEI Database Project

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people’s health when levels in air are high. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year.The Data that used for this project are for 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008.

### DataSet:
you can download the dataset for this project [Emissions Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)
there are two files, PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds) and Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds)

The goal of this project is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.

### what are we going to do:
1- Make a plot showing total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008.

2- Make a plot showing total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland city from 1999 to 2008.

3- Make a plot showing which of the four sources(point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City and Which increased in emissions from 1999–2008

4- Make a plot showing across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008.

5- Make a plot showing how have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City.

6- Make a plot to compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California, Then providing which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions.
